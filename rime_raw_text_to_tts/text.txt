Rime.ai is a cutting-edge voice AI platform that delivers ultra-realistic, emotionally expressive text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. It offers human-like qualities such as laughter, breathing, sighs, and natural disfluencies like “um” or pauses, which make synthetic voices sound remarkably lifelike. The platform is powered by two core models: Arcana and Mist v2. Arcana is a next-generation spoken-language model that can infer emotions from context and even generate entirely new synthetic speakers from fictional descriptions. Mist v2, on the other hand, is optimized for enterprise use, offering sub-200ms latency, high accuracy, and full customization suitable for high-volume, real-time applications.

Founded in 2022, Rime powers millions of voice interactions monthly across industries such as customer support, outbound calling, and fast-food ordering systems. Unlike typical TTS models trained on scripted studio audio, Rime’s models are trained on natural conversational speech, capturing accents, fillers, code-switching, and other sociolinguistic nuances. The platform supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German. It offers flexible deployment options—cloud, virtual private cloud (VPC), or on-premises—and provides developer-friendly APIs with WebSocket support for low-latency streaming. Rime is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant, making it a secure and scalable solution for mission-critical voice applications.
